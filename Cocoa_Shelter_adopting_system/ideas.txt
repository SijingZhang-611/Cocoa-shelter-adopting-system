Two project ideas:

The first project is a shelter animal adoption system with two portals: one for customers and one for shelter staff. In the customer portal, users can browse animals, submit adoption applications, and check their status. The shelter portal allows staff to add new animals, manage listings, and approve or reject applications. This project is ideal for learning about web development in a realistic, real-world setting, as it involves creating user accounts, managing data, and performing CRUD operations. For a Java-based web version, Spring Boot would be useful for server-side logic, while MySQL can be used for database management. One challenge of this project is its complexity, as it requires effective database management and understanding frameworks and tools for building user-friendly interfaces.

The second project is a life choice game where players start with a set amount of health, money, and happiness. Players make choices through events such as investing in stocks, applying for jobs, buying lottery tickets, exercising, and seeking entertainment, each impacting their health, money, or happiness levels. At the end, the game evaluates how well players managed their resources. This project allows flexibility and creativity in designing events and outcomes and can vary in complexity depending on the number of events added. Since the game will be Java-based, it can be created as a web app with Java-based frameworks like Spring Boot for a web interface. However, setting up a fair scoring system and balancing game mechanics could take time and testing.
